<c.white.bgblack>(Proctor)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>That's good, everybody. Get ready. </c>
<c.white.bgblack>We're gonna start the test right now.</c>

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.330  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Here we go. I hope I can do this test. </c>
<c.white.bgblack>Why are we taking it, anyway?</c>

3
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.930  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bg>Huh? "That's a good question"?!?</c>

4
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.360  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Do I want to know the answer? </c>
<c.white.bgblack>Sure, why not?</c>

5
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.430  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Hi, welcome inside MAP.</c>

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.730  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bg>Whoa! What are we doing here?</c>

7
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.440  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bg>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bg>I could tell you were feeling </c>
<c.white.bg>a little </c><c.white.bg>unsure about the test,</c>

8
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.450  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>so I thought I'd give you some tips.</c>

9
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.540  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bg>Alright. So, what's this test about? </c>
<c.white.bg>Will I do well?</c>

10
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.150  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bg>Actually, everybody can do their best.</c>

11
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.240  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Really? Everybody?</c>

12
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.240  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bg>Yeah, as long as you try the best you can.</c>

13
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.990  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>What if my best isn</c><c.white.bg>'t good enough?</c>

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.430  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>With MAP, your best effort is </c><c.white.bg><i>always</i></c><c.white.bg> good enough.</c>

15
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.280  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>It's a chance to see</c><c.white.bg> how far you can go in your learning.</c>

16
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.250  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>What do you mean?</c>

17
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.850  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>I'll </c><c.white.bgblack><i>show</i></c><c.white.bgblack> you what I mean.</c>

18
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.860  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Press that button.</c><c.white.bg> </c><c.white.bg></c>

19
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.810  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Okay.</c>

20
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.890  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna) </c>
<c.white.bgblack>The MAP test</c><c.white.bg>, </c><c.white.bg>is like other things that you try to do better.</c><c.white.bg></c>

21
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.630  align:center  line:-1


22
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.390  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>like how far you can throw a disc,</c>

23
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.150  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>how well you play an instrument</c><c.white.bg>,</c>

24
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.040  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>or even folding origami.</c>

25
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.370  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>What makes it fun is doing it better and better.</c>

26
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.730  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>What’s that got to do with the MAP test?</c>

27
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.120  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bg>Because the MAP test is trying to do your personal best,</c>

28
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.130  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bg>Like this student</c><c.white.bg>...</c>

29
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.420  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>She took the MAP test </c><c.white.bgblack>at the beginning of the year,</c>

30
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.260  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and that told her teacher what she was ready to learn next.</c>

31
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.480  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>So, during school, she worked on getting better</c><c.white.bg>.</c>

32
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.570  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Later on in the year, she took the MAP test again.</c><c.white.bg></c>

33
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.850  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>And this let her know how much she had improved.</c>

34
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.070  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Oh, okay. So what are the MAP questions like?</c>

35
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.880  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Well, let’s try a couple.</c>

36
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.050  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>[finger snap]</c><c.white.bg></c>

37
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.400  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Do not rush.</c>

38
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.110  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>This is not a timed test.</c>

39
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.890  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Well, I already know my answer. </c>
<c.white.bgblack>It’s this one.</c>

40
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.550  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Good. Do you want to press Next?</c>

41
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.550  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>You can always change your answer </c>
<c.white.bgblack>before you go to the next problem.</c><c.white.bg></c>

42
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.460  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Umm. I’m pretty sure. </c>
<c.white.bgblack>Can I change my answer later?</c>

43
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.370  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Not really. As you see, </c>
<c.white.bgblack>there’s only a Next button, not a Back button.</c><c.white.bg></c>

44
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.450  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Okay. I’m ready.</c>

45
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.550  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Good. Now let's try a math question.</c>

46
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.120  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Do you see anything different?</c>

47
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.310  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>You mean the picture in the corner over there?</c>

48
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.360  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bg>Yeah. That’s the calculator.</c>

49
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.280  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>The calculator appears when</c>

50
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.790  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>you might need help with math facts or problems.</c><c.white.bg></c>

51
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.190  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>So, what do you think?</c>

52
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.670  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>I think I don’t know the answer. </c>
<c.white.bgblack>Can we skip this one?</c>

53
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.780  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bg>You have to answer every question,</c>

54
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.020  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bg>before you go on to the next problem.</c>

55
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.820  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bg>But I haven’t seen this kind of question before.</c>

56
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.150  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Well, try this when a question's unfamiliar.</c>

57
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.760  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Start by taking away the choices that you know are wrong.</c><c.white.bg></c>

58
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.220  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Well, I know the two bottom ones are too big.</c>

59
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.420  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bg>Great. Now just choose from what’s left.</c>

60
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.500  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Then I think it’s this one.</c>

61
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.800  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bg>Wow, good for you.</c>

62
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.810  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bg>Go ahead and press Next.</c><c.white.bg></c>

63
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.250  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bg>But I still don’t understand.</c>

64
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.270  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bg>Why put on those kinds of questions </c>
<c.white.bg>that I haven’t seen before?</c>

65
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.110  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bg>The MAP test gives </c><c.white.bg>you new and harder questions,</c>

66
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.770  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bg>to see what you’re ready to learn next.</c>

67
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.790  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>But what if I get the question wrong?</c>

68
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.670  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bg>You don't have to get </c><c.white.bg><i>every</i></c><c.white.bg> question correct.</c>

69
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.150  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Then how many do I have to get right?</c>

70
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.630  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bg>As many as you can. Remember, it's </c><c.white.bg><i>your </i></c><c.white.bg>personal best,</c>

71
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.390  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bg>so whatever that is, it’s fine.</c>

72
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.180  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bg>Plus, the MAP test isn't always so hard.</c>

73
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.040  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bg>Oh, okay. That makes sense.</c>

74
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.550  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>[gong rings out]</c><c.white.bg></c>

75
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.400  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bg>It’s time!</c>

76
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.970  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bg>Time for what?</c>

77
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.300  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Joanna)</c>
<c.white.bg>Time to see how far you can go on the MAP test.</c>

78
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.290  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Cool! Thanks for the help.</c>

79
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.290  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Proctor)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Okay. You ready to get started on this test?</c><c.white.bg></c>

80
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.880  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Brady)</c>
<c.white.bg>Yeah. I want to see how far I can go.</c>

81
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.000  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Proctor)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>That's great.</c><c.white.bg></c>

82
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.250  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bg>Okay, here's what you do:</c>

83
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.560  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bg>In that first box, you're going to type</c>
<c.white.bg>the test session name...</c>
