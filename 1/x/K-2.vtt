<c.white.bg>(Ms. Gracie) </c>
<c.white.bg>Hi. Welcome to my classroom.</c>

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.590  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bg>I'm Ms. Gracie and this is Eli.</c>

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.580  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Today we're going to do some special work</c>

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.410  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack></c><c.white.bgblack>on the computer that helps me know</c>

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.340  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>what to teach you next.</c>

6
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.780  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Are you ready, Eli?</c>

7
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.660  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Eli)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Yeah, I'm ready.</c>

8
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.340  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>How does it work?</c>

9
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.680  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Ms. Gracie)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>You'll hear some questions</c>

10
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.250  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and get to pick your answer.</c>

11
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.140  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Pick the choice you think is right.</c>

12
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.060  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Here's what a question looks like.</c>

13
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.900  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Can you hear the teacher talking?</c>

14
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.260  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Eli) </c>
<c.white.bgblack>He's too quiet.</c>

15
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.840  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Ms. Gracie) Click this speaker button</c>

16
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.350  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>to open the slider.</c>

17
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.900  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Make the volume louder or softer</c>

18
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.830  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>by moving the dot.</c>

19
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.200  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(test narrator)</c>
<c.white.bg>...begin with the letter G.</c>

20
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.980  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Eli)</c>
<c.white.bg>That's better.</c>

21
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.110  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>You can click anything that has</c>

22
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.500  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>a speaker to listen to it again.</c>

23
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.000  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Eli)</c>
<c.white.bg>Okay.</c>

24
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.050  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I think the goat and gift are right.</c>

25
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.290  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Ms. Gracie)</c>
<c.white.bg>Good job, Eli!</c>

26
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.840  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Are you done with that question?</c>

27
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.890  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Eli)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Yep. I think it's right.</c>

28
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.330  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Let's try another one.</c>

29
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.410  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Ms. Gracie)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Sure. Click the Next button.</c>

30
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.380  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Eli)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>This one is tricky.</c>

31
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.660  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I never saw that kind of math before.</c>

32
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.590  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Ms. Gracie)</c>
<c.white.bg>That's okay, Eli.</c>

33
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.360  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>We haven't learned this yet in school.</c>

34
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.860  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Eli)</c>
<c.white.bg>Should I just pick anything?</c>

35
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.010  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Ms. Gracie)</c>
<c.white.bg>Look at your choices</c><c.white.bgblack> and</c>

36
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.460  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>pick the one you think it might be.</c>

37
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.960  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Eli)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Hmm. Maybe it's 16.</c>

38
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.290  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>No, that's too low of a number</c>

39
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.700  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bg>and 25 is too high.</c>

40
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.340  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I think 20 is my best choice.</c>

41
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.980  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Ms. Gracie)</c>
<c.white.bg>Good work, Eli.</c>

42
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.870  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>It's okay when a question seems hard.</c>

43
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.140  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Think about when you jump rope.</c>

44
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.430  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>That was hard when you first tried, right?</c>

45
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.780  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Eli)</c>
<c.white.bg>It was,</c>

46
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.960  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>but now I can do 17 jumps in a row.</c>

47
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.860  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Ms. Gracie)</c>
<c.white.bg>That's great!</c>

48
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.950  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>This test is like jumping rope.</c>

49
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.570  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>When a question gets harder,</c>

50
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.920  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>it's like doing another jump in a row.</c>

51
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.550  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>So, keep trying to answer every question</c>

52
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.200  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>and </c><c.white.bg>see how far you can go.</c>

53
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.600  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Eli)</c>
<c.white.bg>Okay, Ms. Gracie.</c>

54
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.590  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>I'll try hard when jumping rope</c>

55
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.090  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack><i>and</i></c><c.white.bgblack> when taking this test.</c>

56
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.820  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Should I click Next again?</c><c.white.bg></c>

57
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.610  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Ms. Gracie)</c>
<c.white.bg>That's right, Eli.</c>

58
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.750  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Click Next to keep going.</c>

59
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.630  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Eli)</c>
<c.white.bg>I think I've got it now.</c>

60
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.470  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Are </c><c.white.bgblack><i>you </i></c><c.white.bgblack>reading for </c><c.white.bgblack><i>your </i></c><c.white.bgblack>turn?</c>

61
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.580  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>(Mrs. Gracie)</c>
<c.white.bgblack>Great idea, Eli.</c>

62
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.200  align:center  line:-1
<c.white.bgblack>Let's practice answering some questions.</c><c.white.bg></c>
